## About
[Finnish Meteorological Institute opened its obervation data to free use in 2013](https://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/avoin-data). The open data service
is however designed for software developers and is almost impossible to use for other people. 
Since not all enthusiasts and researchers have programming skills to use the service themselves, there was a need for simple utility-application to download the weather data into Excel format.

This downloadable application was originally developed by request of [Lammi Biological Station](http://www.helsinki.fi/lammi/).
