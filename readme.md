This is a simple application to provide a graphical user interface to download weather data from [Finnish Meteorological Institute's open data service]((https://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/avoin-data). The application was originally developed for [Lammi Biological Station's](http://www.helsinki.fi/lammi/) needs.

At this point application supports downloads of daily and real time obseration data from FMI's Finnish weather stations and has Finnish and Eglish user interface. For more information about the usage and downloads, head to the website of the application or go directly to [download page](https://github.com/Tumetsu/Ilmatieteenlaitoksen-saadata-lataaja/releases) 

Please note that this application **is not made by FMI!** It only uses the open data service provided by FMI.


Material
---------
The data downloaded by this program is directly from FMI's server. User should follow the [license of the data described in FMI's service](http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/avoin-data-lisenssi). When using the data in your work, research etc. it is your responsibility to follow the guidelines and licenses of the FMI.

For software developers
-------------

This application was put together rapidly using Python3, PyQt5 and few other libraries. As such especially the GUI code haven't been cleaned that much. I might clean it in near future by breaking it to several smaller functions and classes. Note however, that the API-code has been placed into its own module. I'm not sure if I'll do much further development for this project, so forks and pull requests are welcome if you are so inclined. Finnish researchers really seem to have a need for this kind of application. 

I think that this kind of tool might work better as a webservice. I decided to build a standalone version to avoid having to maintain server. The fmi-module's code should be easily portable to a backend Python frameworks as it is (for example Django).

Requirements
--------------------

Below are Python3 requirements needed to run the program. You'll also need PyQt5.

    lxml==3.4.2
	nose==1.3.4
	numpy==1.8.2
	pandas==0.15.2
	py2exe==0.9.2.2
	python-dateutil==2.4.0
	pytz==2014.10
	six==1.9.0


You can package application to an runnable standalone by

    python3 setup.py py2exe

After this you have to copy OHJEKIRJA.pdf, stations.csv, translations folder and Qt's platforms directory to a dist directory generated by py2exe. The Qt platforms directory can be found from:

    C:\Python34\Lib\site-packages\PyQt5\plugins\platforms

The dist folder can be transformed into intall setup with. [InnoSetup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) There is a sample script for it which has to be moved into dist folder before compiling the setup.exe.

Yes, the py2exe process should be optimized. I suppose it would be pretty easy to add options to include those extra directories automatically.

Thanks

Thank you to John Loehr from University of Helsinki for proof reading the English translations as well as getting the application submitted to University's software portal.
