## Installation instructions Windows
After downloading the setup.exe and follow the instructions on screen. After installation there should be "FMIDownloader" on your startup-menu.

## University of Helsinki software portal
In case you belong to University of Helsinki, chances are that you can't install any software to your work-pc. The software is available in 
university's software portal and can be installed by:

> Start-menu -> All programs -> HY -> Software Portal and search for "Ilmatieteenlaitoksen saadata-lataaja"

## Mac?
The application should be possible to compile for Mac OSX since it uses Python and PyQt5. At least it works from sourcecode but I haven't had time to build a proper
.app -file for it.
